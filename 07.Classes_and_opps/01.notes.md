# javascript & classes

Q. Do JavaScript really have classes?
A. Yes, JavaScript introduced the concept of classes in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which was released in 2015. Prior to ES6, JavaScript used prototype-based inheritance, but the introduction of classes made it more familiar and convenient for developers coming from languages with class-based inheritance, such as Java or C++.
