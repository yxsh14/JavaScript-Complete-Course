    // A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
    function makeFunc(){
        const name="mozilla"
        function displayName(){
            console.log(name);
        }
        return displayName; //When we return a function not only the function context is passed it's lexical scoping is also passed.
    }
    const myFunc=makeFunc();
    myFunc(); //mozilla
