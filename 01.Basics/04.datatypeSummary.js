/*On the bases of putting data in memory and also how we are accessing it. There are two types of datatype:
1. Primitive : A copy is created while accessing these type and if we make changes, they are only happening in the copy.
    7 types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol

2. Non- primitive (reference type) : The reference of these data type can be allocated to you meaning changes made in such types will reflect in original structure.
    Array, Objects, Functions
    Datatype of all the Non-primitive data type is object.


JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.*/

// Stack & Heap Memory
/*stack memory is used in primitive data type.
heap memory is used in non-primitive data type.*/
